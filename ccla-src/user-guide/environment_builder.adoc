* **API Server IP/Host** : This value is usually the IP address of the Master Node in the Kubernetes cluster

* API Server Port :The API server is generally exposed on the port 6443 by default. Cloudclapp will check if the specific port on the given IP is reachable before Import. In a kubeconfig file, both of the above values are in the server field for a cluster
