1. Check your Docker engine has access to DockerHub. You can, for instance, run `docker run hello-world` to test the access.
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart.git` to clone the GitHub repository on you computer.
3. `$ cd quickstart`
4. `$ sudo docker login` (check the note below)
5. `$ sudo docker-compose up -d` to create the mini lab composed of the {product_name} containers and managed entites to experiment on.
6. Browse: link:https://localhost/[] and connect with username `ncroot` and password `ubiqube`. The portal might take a few minutes to be up and running.

IMPORTANT: for `docker login`, use the Docker ID "msa2trial" and the link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/[access token] provided by your main point of contact at UBiqube. 

NOTE: In case you have updated the {product_name} with `docker-compose up -d` or `docker-compose pull`, you might experience cache issues (for instance, your changes may not be reflected on the UI). To solve that, you can clean your browser cache, or use a browser private session.
