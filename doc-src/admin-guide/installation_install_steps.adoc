1. check your docker engine has access to dockerhub                                                                               <1>

3. $ cd quickstart
4. $ sudo docker login                                                                  <3>

----
<1> Run `docker run hello-world` to test the access.
<2> Clone the github repository on your docker engine (directly on your PC or on a Linux VM).
<3> You need to have you own Docker ID. Authorisation is granted by UBiqube.
<4> `docker-compose` will create the mini lab which is composed of the {product_name} containers link:managed_entities{outfilesuffix}[managed entities] that you can use to experiment on.
<5> The portal might take a few minutes to be up and running.

NOTE: In case you have updated the {product_name} with `docker-compose up -d` or `docker-compose pull`, you might experience cache issue (for instance, your changes may not be reflected on the UI). To solve that, you can clean your browser cache or use a browser private session.
