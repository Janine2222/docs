== Overview

The {product_name} uses Elasticsearch and Kibana to provide data indexing and searching as well as the dashboards that can be customized and exposed with a custom manager dashboard.

== Log Retention Policy

Log retention policy allows to configure and manage the lifecycle of the indexes in Elasticsearch.

There are 3 main types of indexes such as the ones used for the syslogs (`ubilogs-\*`), the alarms (`ubialarms-*`) or the audit logs (`ubiaudit-*`). 
For each type, the data is stored in a daily index.
A new index is created every days.

A log retention policy can be configured for each type and a specific policy may be assigned for each index.

For example, you may want to keep the syslogs indexed and online (searchable with the {product_name} UI) for 3 months, but the alarms should be kept for a longer period of time like 1 year.

You can learn how to configure the retention policies by reading the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html[Elasticsearch ILM,window=_blank] documentation.

The ILM configuration is done with the Kibana UI (http://localhost/kibana), in the Stack Management section, under Index Lifecycle Policies
