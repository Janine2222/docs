If you have installed the {product_name} with the quickstart, you already have a trial license limited to 5 Managed Entities and valid for 30 days to get started.

In case you are starting to do a longer PoC or need to have a production license, you probably have received a new license from your UBiqube sales representative.
In that case you need to use this documentation to activate the new license.

== License activation

You must be connected as a privileged administrator (ncroot) to install the license.

As a privileged administrator, click on the link "Setting" on the left menu.
