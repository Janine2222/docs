== Overview

The {product_name} Docker application has the following structure:

image:images/docker_containers.png[overall architecture]

== Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, first install link:https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] on your machine. 
Next install link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose] on your machine.

== Installing the application

The easiest way to get started with the {product_name} is to use the link:https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart[quickstart guide on github].

This quickstart guide will setup a mini-lab composed of the MSA-2 containers as well as a Linux container that you can use to experiment on. (see below for mode details)

1. check your dockerhub account password - or create a new account
2. ask for access to private repo: `ubiqube/msa2`
3. check your docker engine has access to dockerhub
4. clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart.git`
5. `cd quickstart`
6. run: `docker login`
7. run: `docker-compose up -d`
8. browse: https://localhost/ and connect as username `ncroot`, password `ubiqube`

NOTE: It might take a few minutes after connecting to https://localhost/ to be able to login.

NOTE: There might be a pop-up warning of a self-signed cert that needs to be accepted to proceed.

.Access to Dockerhub
NOTE: To get the access to the UBiqube dockerhub private repository please contact us at msa-trial@ubiqube.com.

When Docker Compose is done deploying and the MSA platform is running, you will be able to open the dashboard at link:https://127.0.0.1[]. 

When you see the following output, the MSA platform is ready to be used

```
Creating quickstart_linux_me_1 ... done
Creating quickstart_es_1       ... done
Creating quickstart_db_1       ... done
Creating quickstart_ui_1       ... done
Creating quickstart_kibana_1   ... done
Creating quickstart_camunda_1  ... done
Creating quickstart_api_1      ... done
Creating quickstart_front_1    ... done
```

If you get a gateway error, the web server is probably still starting and you may have to wait for 10-20 more seconds before trying again.

To get an interactive shell on the MSA main container (this will be needed later)
```
docker-compose exec api bash
```
[#mini-lab]
=== Mini-lab details 
image:images/minilab_containers.png[mini lab containers]
 
In addition to add a Linux container (linux.me / 172.20.0.101) for experimentation, the mini-lab also comes with the following pre-installed:

. A trial license valid for 30 days, limited to 5 Managed Entities
. The REST Generic adapter from link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adaptors/tree/master/adapters/rest_generic[github.com/openmsa/Adaptors]
. A set of Micorservices from various vendors from link:https://github.com/openmsa/Microservices[github.com/openmsa/Microservices]
. A predefined environment with a tenant and a customer

To automatically create the teant, the customer and the managed entity, you can run the CLI command

```
docker-compose exec api /usr/bin/create_tenant_customer.sh
```

This will create a tenant, one customer named "Tyrell" and a managed entity named "linux_me" with a fixed management IP 172.20.0.101

image:images/quickstart_linux_me.png[]


You can connect to linux_me with the CLI command `docker-compose exec linux_me bash`

```
$ docker-compose exec linux_me bash

[root@linux_me /]# ifconfig

```


== Breaking down/resetting the quickstart environment
To fully clean up or reset the environment, run the following commands:

1. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down`
2. `docker volume prune -f`
3. `docker ps -a | grep "ubiqube" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm`
4. `docker images | grep "ubiqube" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs docker rmi`

This will give you a clean environment next time you run docker-compose up.

To completely clean up your docker images you can also do `docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)`.

WARNING: this will wipe out every images from your docker engine.


== Requirements on the host machine
.on a PC
- 4GB, 2CPU, 100GB

.on a production environment 
- minimum 16GB, 4CPU, 200GB

=== Docker for Linux (or Linux VM)
----
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
echo 'vm.max_map_count = 262144' > /etc/sysctl.d/50-msa.conf
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/50-msa.conf
----

=== Docker for Mac

From the command line, run:
----
screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/tty
----	
Press enter and use`sysctl` to configure vm.max_map_count:
----
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
----	
To exit the screen session, type Ctrl a d.

=== Docker for Windows
----
docker-machine create -d virtualbox  \
	--virtualbox-cpu-count=2 \
	--virtualbox-memory=8192 \
	--virtualbox-disk-size=50000 \
	default
----

In the docker VM, do as for Linux host above:
----
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf <<< "vm.max_map_count=262144"
----

The docker VM is mapped to a local IP on the Windows host,
access to the msa is _NOT_ done via `https://localhost`,
you must lookup the IP with:

```
$ docker-machine ls
NAME      ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER     ERRORS
default   *        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v19.03.5
```
