Welcome to the MSActivator documentation.

This documentation contains both developer guides, to get you started developing applications for servers, and tutorials on how to build Microservices and Workflows on the MSActivator. These documents will also help address specific features and examples of Microservices and Workflows.

== Getting started with The MSActivator
The link:Getting_Started/getting-started-with-the-msactivator{outfilesuffix}[Getting Started with the MSActivator] explains the main concept, as well as the first steps in managing services with the MSActivator.

== Developer Guides
- The link:Configuration/Microservices/getting-started-developing-microservices{outfilesuffix}[Getting Started Developing Microservices] shows you how to build Microservices and deploy them in the MSActivator. 
The guide starts by showing you a simple user management use case on a Linux system. You'll also discover how to deploy a Microservice on the MSActivator.

- The link:Automation/getting-started-developing-workflows{outfilesuffix}[Getting Started Developing Workflows] shows you how to build Workflows and run them in the MSActivator.

== Use Cases
- The link:Use_Cases/Vendor_Use_Cases/Linux/iptables-management-with-a-microservice{outfilesuffix}[iptables Management with a Microservice] is a simple use case that shows how to manage firewalls with a Linux system.
