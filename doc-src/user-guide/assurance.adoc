The {product_name} provides an assurance module for collecting network events and managing alarms

All the events sent by the managed or monitored entities are collected, indexed and analyzed centrally.

== Log analysis
=== Overview

The {product_name} can collect, index and store events received from the managed entities. 
Once indexed, the logs are fully searchable from the user interface.

== Alarm management
=== Overview
The alarm management module is based on the detection of events which internal (VNOC), SNMP thresholds, or sylogs sent by the managed devices and collected by the {product_name}. 
Alarm management is designed to provide email notifications to customers or managers, to send SNMP traps to an external trap server, or trigger predetermined automated processes.

The detection of events relies on rules configured at the super administrator level. 
Rule management is available for the super administrator (ncroot). The rules are defined globally and can be modified by the SOC team. 
The SOC team can modify the setting of the notification  on a per-event and/or per-customer basis. 
The rules are executed on a periodic basis (the period frequency can be configured) and alarms are generated whenever a rule matches.
