== Why a new UX?

*Vision*: MSA is to enable a ‘DevOps-ready’ Orchestration Continuum to enable the design of integrated automation solutions across the entire tech ecosystem (datacenter to WAN, edge computing and IoT: all wrapped with security).


*Target users*:  SI engineers developing (DevOps) end-to-end solutions for their business customers, or end-users managing the lifecycle of their infrastructure or the services they are deploying (Telco, Cloud, MSSP, etc.).


A UX reflecting the above wide variety of technical scenarios and user experiences was required and it became obvious that *this redesign was becoming a critical enabler of this strategy*.

== MSA-2.0 NG Key Requirements

. A UX providing two navigation environments to address both types of user:
* *A developer-centric environment*.
* *An end-user-centric environment*.
. A UX structure in line with our modular MSActivator marketing (microservices, workflows, etc.) for consistency and greater concept adoption.
. A universal taxonomy (naming and tagging) that would appeal to the entire ecosystem no matter the domain or the use case (datacenter, services, security, networking, wireless, wireline, IoT, etc.).
. A modern UX where navigation experience matters more than feature list.
. A UX that connects to our community for greater intel and information-sharing among all of the MSActivator users and developers.
. A UX that becomes an evergreen platform, which we continue to improve over time, making our ‘agility by design’ claim a tangible reality for our customers and partners.
. A UX that becomes a strategic module of the MSActivator strategy as we head towards 5G, edge computing and IoT.
