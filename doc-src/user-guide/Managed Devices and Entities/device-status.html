          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>Every device that is configured with the MSActivator has a status. The status of each device is shown in the device list as a coloured dot next to the device’s name.</p>
          <p>Device statuses are generated by evaluating the connectivity between the MSActivator and each device. By default, the MSActivator uses the Internet Control Message Protocol, or ICMP, to check connectivity.</p>
          <p>There are four different statuses. Blue means that this device has never been activated before and requires <a href="../Getting Started/managed-devices.adoc">initial provisioning</a>.</p>
          <p>Red means that the device has been activated before, but it is not reachable at the moment.</p>
          <p>A yellow dot indicates a critical status. The status is critical if the device cannot be reached for a duration of 5 minutes. After these 5 minutes have passed, and if the device is still unreachable, its status is set to red. If the device can be reached within these 5 minutes, however, its status is set back to green.</p>
          <p>A green dot means that the connectivity between the MSActivator and the device has been established and it is working properly.</p>
          <p>Administrators can see an overview of device statuses of each tenant and customer in the “Customers” Tab.</p>
