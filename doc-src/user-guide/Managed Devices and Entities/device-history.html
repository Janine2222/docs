          <h1>Configuration Change Management</h1>
          <p>The last tab on the device page is called “History”.</p>
          <p>It provides information about your hardware, the different versions of firmware and licences, as well as information on the device configuration.</p>
          <h2>Asset History Management</h2>
          <p>The system keeps the history of the assets that were installed on the device and creates an internal event (prefixed by "<span class="confluence-link">VNOC</span>") event that can be used to trigger <a href="../Assurance/alarm-management.adoc">alarms</a>.</p>
          <p>The managed assets are defined and discovered by the device adaptor and can be customized to adapt to the device model or by adding additional properties.</p>
          <h5>Illustration with a Firewall</h5>
          <p>The firmware version is v6.0.0.</p>

          </a></p>
          <p>After the image upgrade to v6.0.1, the firmware inventory shows the history of the images that were applied.</p>

          <p>The alarm management shows the VNOC event raised by the upgrade.</p>

          <h2>Configuration Change Management</h2>
          <p>The MSActivator maintains all the versions of the running configurations of the managed devices in its configuration database.</p>
          <p>Every time the MSActivator configures a device or detects a configuration change, it will fetch the current configuration, version it and store it in its configuration database.</p>
          <p>This configuration will be available later to manage configuration changes.</p>

            <p>Note</p>
            <div>
              <p>Every night the MSActivator analyses the configuration of all its managed devices and tracks modifications that may have been done manually on the device.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The configuration history is available on the Devices page, then going to the "History" tab and selecting "Change Mgt".</p>

          <p>The change management shows the list of all configuration versions that were archived since the device's <a href="../Getting Started/getting-started-with-the-msactivator.adoc">initial provisioning:</a></p>
