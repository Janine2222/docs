The quickstart guide will gets you started with the {product_name} orchestration tool.

This guide is composed of a link:https://github.com/ubiqube/quickstart[git repository] which is mainly a set of docker and docker-compose files to pull the {product_name} from Dockerhub 

The docker-compose will create the {product_name} containers and a Managed Entity that you can use to become familiar with the {product_name}.

This mini lab is detailed in the link:../admin-guide/installation{outfilesuffix}[installation guide]
