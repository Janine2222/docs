==== Status Graphes

This graph is very convenient, as it represents a lot of data in a small area.
Firstly, it is made up of three concentric circles:
- The outer circle represents physical entities.
- The middle circle represents public entities.
- The inner circle represents private entities.

To further illustrate this, a legend is provided on the dashboard to explain each circle purpose:

NOTE: It is up to the MSActivator to decide the type of each entity when they are configuring that entity entry.

Finally, the number in the center of the circles is the total number of managed entities associated with that customer.
If you click on any of those status graphs, you then see a pop-up table containing the same details but in a matrix like so:
