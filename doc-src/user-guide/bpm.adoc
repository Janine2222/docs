*BPM* (Business Process Management) allow the execution of complex business processes by automating a flow of workflow execution.

== Overview

The integrated BPM engine can be accessed by clicking the "Automation" link in the left menu. 

You need to select a subtenant to see the list of BPM that can be executed for a specific subtenant. BPM definition and instances work in a similar way as for workflows: you first need to associate a BPM to a subtenant and then each execution of a BPM will create a new instance that can be managed.

Use the "i" (information icon) to open a BPM instance and view it's detailed status.

A BPM instance can be deleted with the "trash" icon.
