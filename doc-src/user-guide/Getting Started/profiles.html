          <p>Within the MSActivator, there are two kinds of profiles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="../Assurance/monitoring-profile.adoc">Monitoring Profiles</a></li>
            <li><a href="../Configuration/configuration-profile.adoc">Configuration Profiles</a> - to aggregate multiple functions for several devices.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Monitoring profiles let you define a set of Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, and monitor them on multiple devices.</p>
          <p>When choosing the KPIs you want to observe, you can also add other variables such as the frequency the information is retreived, and the threshold for alarm generation.</p>
          <p>This works on all kinds of devices that support SNMP, the Simple Network Management Protocol.</p>
          <p>Configuration profiles, on the other hand, are an easy way to configure a set of functionalities on multiple devices.</p>
          <p>For example, if your customer has several devices of the same kind, a configuration profile can be created according to the service you want to provide on all of these devices.</p>
          <p>This process not only saves a lot of time and minimizes the risk of manual errors - when compared to configuring each functionality for each seperate device - but also provides a way to implement a consistent set of managed services across multiple devices and end customers.</p>
          <p>The profile can then be attached to the selected devices to achieve a quick and consistent configuration. Please note that a device can only be linked to one configuration profile.</p>
