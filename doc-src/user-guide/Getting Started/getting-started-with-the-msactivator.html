          <h1>Overview of the MSActivator<sup>TM</sup></h1>
          <p>The MSActivator is a vendor-agnostic, multi-tenant service orchestration software designed for agile service orchestration fulfillment and assurance of physical and virtual networking services.</p>
          <p>The MSActivator spans across multiple domains (legacy hardware, SDN, NFV, etc.) and manages network devices as well as SDN controllers, VIM, VNFM, or any other system.</p>
          <p>Within the MSActivator framework, every entity that needs to be managed across the value chain is called a "device". Device configuration updates are pushed by "adaptors", which handle the communication with individual devices.</p>
          <p>Configuration updates are built by stacking Create | Read | Update | Delete and Import orders in "microservices". Microservices provide the needed abstraction layer for multi-vendor, multi-tenant and multi-domain support.</p>
          <p>Service orchestration is done by designing microservices via the Workflow Builder module. "Workflows" are composed of a set of processes. A process is a suite of tasks designed to accomplish a specific goal. Tasks include microservices, scripts, and other methods of single-outcome programming.</p>
          <p>Microservice and process definitions can be designed graphically on the fly (i.e. scripting not required) and are stored in central libraries. Workflows and microservices can be instantiated at will.</p>
          <p>In addition to fulfillment capabilities, the MSActivator features service assurance, analytics and customer self-care. These modules, along with the orchestration capabilities, are highly customizable and designed to provide intent-based automation.</p>
          <h1>Main Concepts</h1>
          <h2>Data Model and Management</h2>
          <p>The web portal is structured around the following entities:</p>
          <h3><strong>Data model</strong>:</h3>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Device</strong>: Any managed component in the user's network (i.e. routers, switches, firewalls, UTM, IPPBX, VIM, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Customer</strong>: A tenancy level where devices can be grouped. (i.e. an Enterprise)</li>
          <li><strong>Operator</strong>: A tenancy level where customer can be grouped (i.e. a Service Provider)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><strong>Management</strong>:</h3>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Repository</strong>: A central location where configuration templates, microservices, firmware, licences, reports, etc. are stored and organized</li>
          <li><strong>Profile:</strong> A set of configuration or monitoring policies applicable to specific devices</li>
          <li><strong>Microservice</strong>: A configuration object for managing services</li>
          <li><strong>Operator Console</strong>: The web console and user interface for administrators, operators and managers</li>
          <li><strong>Customer Portal</strong>: A customizable portal for customer self-care access</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The first thing the manager has to do is create a device within the customer environment. Regardless of the deployed vendor, the next steps apply:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Staging:</strong> Configure the device with a minimum set of commands to provide network connectivity.</li>
          <li><strong>Initial Provisioning:</strong>When the staged device is connected, the initial provisioning will remotely connect to the device and automatically configure the device with the initial configuration pre-determined by the chosen template.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once the device is activated it can be managed using templates and microservices, which are stored in the central repository.</p>
          <h2>Users and Role Based Access Model</h2>
          <p>Configurations are applied to devices.</p>
          <p>Devices are managed by the services providers, called managers. The reporter to a manager is called an operator. The operator is a tenant. The MSActivator allows multiple tenants to co-exist on the same platform (a multitenant platform).</p>
          <p>This model leads to classical rule mapping or <strong>R</strong>ole <strong>B</strong>ased <strong>A</strong>ccess <strong>M</strong>odel as illustrated below:</p>

          <p>The guide to <a href="../Getting Started/tenants-and-users.adoc">Tenants and Users</a> will help you create your first tenants and users after the initial installation of the MSActivator. The guide to <a href="../Getting Started/managed-devices.adoc">Managed Devices</a> will help you get started with device creation and activation.</p>
