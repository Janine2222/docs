          <p>The configuration repository is used to store configuration files, which can later be used in file-based configuration profiles or can be directly attached to Devices.</p>
          <h3>Actions on the Repository Top Node</h3>
          <h4>Add an Operator</h4>
          <p><img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Add_operator.gif" width="16"/> : adds an operator to this repository</p>

          <h3>Actions on the Operator Nodes</h3>
          <p>As one or more operator(s) can be associated with a Configuration repository, an operator can also be associated with a Customer or a Manufacturer.</p>
          <h4>Add a Customer</h4>
          <p><img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Add_customer.gif" width="16"/> : the user can select and add one or more customers from its managed customer list.</p>

          <h4>Add a Manufacturer</h4>
          <p><img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Add_manufacturer.gif" width="16"/> : the user can select and add the managed device manufacturers.</p>
          <p>Adding a Manufacturer acts as a filter: any file uploaded in a sub-folder of a Manufacturer will only be available for the selected Manufacturer.</p>
          <h3>Actions on the Customer Node</h3>
          <p><img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Add_manufacturer.gif" width="16"/> : the user can select and add the managed device manufacturers.</p>
          <p>Files uploaded to a sub-folder of a selected manufacturer will only be available for the devices of that manufacturer (which are also attached to the selected customer).</p>
          <h3>Adding/Removing Folders and Files</h3>
          <h4>Adding/Removing Folders and Files</h4>
          <p><img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Add_directory.gif" width="16"/> : the user can add a sub-folder to any of the following: Customer, Manufacturer or folder.<img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Action_delete.gif" width="14"/> : the user can delete any of the following: Customer, Manufacturer, folder or file.</p>
          <p>The delete action is not available if the object is attached to a template-based configuration profile or a device, or if the object is a folder which contains a file attached to a template-based configuration profile or a device.Hovering over the <img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Help.gif" width="16"/> icon displays the list of profiles and devices that have a reference to any of the files in the corresponding sub-tree.</p>
          <h4>Add Files</h4>
          <p><img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Add_upload_Configuration.gif" width="16"/> the user can add a file to the selected folder.Via the dialog window, the user can either upload a file from his file system (<img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Action_upload.gif" width="16"/> Import from disk), or create a new file directly (<img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Modify.gif" width="16"/> Create new file).</p>
          <p>Only text files can be uploaded in the configuration repository. Binary file upload is not supported.</p>
          <p>If the User chooses to create a new file (
            <img alt="Icon" height="16" src="images/Modify.gif" width="16"/>), they will be able to create it via the edition window:</p>
          <p><a class="image-popup-fit-width" href="">
              <img alt="Image" src="images/image2018-4-5_16-55-33.png" width="800"/>
          </a></p>
          <p>A File name, a Tag and a free text Comment can be given to the a file.</p>
          <p>Depending on the repository selected (Workflow, Microservices,etc.), the system will create the proper file.</p>
          <div class="confluence-information-macro-information">
            <p class="title">NOTE: Don't forget to add the .xml extension to the name of the Workflow when creating the file, otherwise the Workflow will not be available in order to to be attached to a customer.</p>
            
            
          </div>
          <h4>Add Files in Folder AutoAttached</h4>
          <p>The user can automatically attach a file to a device when the device is created. This is useful when services have to be automatically associated to devices.</p>
          <p>In order to define the set of files (templates or microservices) to associate to a device, the files must be uploaded under a folder that goes by the name "AutoAttached". There is no dedicated action button to create this folder, therefore it is up to the user to make sure that the folder name and its location is correct.</p>
          <p>The folder AutoAttached has to be created under a Model folder, otherwise the files it contains will be ignored.</p>
          <p>In the example below, every file found under AutoAttached will automatically be attached to all newly created Fortinet/Generic.</p>
