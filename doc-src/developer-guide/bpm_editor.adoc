Use your mouse to add tasks and link them together.

NOTE: A BPM process must have a StartEvent and an EndEvent.

NOTE: Only one executable BPM process can be designed at a time. 

You can save your BPM at anytime and edit it later. When you save you BPM, you need to select a sub-tenant.

NOTE: A BPM is associated to a single sub-tenant.
