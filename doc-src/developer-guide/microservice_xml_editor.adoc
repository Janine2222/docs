== Overview

The main difference between the CLI and REST (Json/XML) Microservice definition is the implementation of the functions Create/Update/...

CLI Microservice definition is covered in this documentation: link:microservice_editor{outfilesuffix}[Microservice Editor].

This documentation uses the link:https://github.com/openmsa/Adaptors/tree/master/adapters/rest_generic[REST Generic adapter] and the {product_name} REST API to illustrate the design of XML Microservice.
