== Overview

This tutorial walks you through the design and development of your first workflow.

link:../user-guide/automation_workflows{outfilesuffix}[Workflows] can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks and processes, such as:

- Service configuration chaining
- VNF lifecycle management
- Configuration audit and verification
- Automated customer on-boarding
- ...

== The "Hello world" Workflow

As an example, we'll use the "Helloworld" workflow. The "Helloworld" workflow will print a name as IN parameter and will display a message to the user ("Hello NAME").

This workflow is composed of 3 processes: one to create the new instance of the workflow, one to enter the name and print it, and one to delete the instance.

=== Create a New Workflow

From the Workflow repository, select the folder "Helloworld" and create a new Workflow.

In the tab "Information", set a name, a description and set the Workflow variable name to service_id.

Create a variable "Name" in the tab "Variable:

Save your Workflow and attach it to your customer (customer page, tab "WORKFLOWS", sub-tab "Workflows", click on the green "+" icon on the left and select "Helloworld" Workflow from the repository).

=== Create the Processes

==== The "create instance" Process

In order to be used, every Workflow should be instantiated first. This is the role of the process with the type "Create".

NOTE: even though for most use cases, one "Create" process is sufficient, it is possible to have several "Create" processes to handle one or more ways of creating the Workflow instance.

For this tutorial you will create one process named "create instance" and add one task to this process. This task will simply display a message to the process execution console.
[source, php]
----
<?php
/**
 * This file is necessary to include to use all the in-built libraries of /opt/fmc_repository/Reference/Common
 */
require_once '/opt/fmc_repository/Process/Reference/Common/common.php';
/**
 * List all the parameters required by the task
 */
function list_args() { }
/**
 * End of the task do not modify after this point
 */
task_exit(ENDED, "workflow initialised");
?>
----

Once done, save the Workflow.

==== The "delete instance" Process

Follow the same steps as in the "create instance" process, but make sure that the type of the process is set to "Delete", instead of "Create".

==== The "print message" Process

For the print process, use the process type "Update". It will take one parameter that will be used to print your message. Use the code below to create a task that will read the name from the user form and print it in the live console.

[source, php]
----
<?php
/**
 * This file is necessary to include to use all the in-built libraries of /opt/fmc_repository/Reference/Common
 */
require_once '/opt/fmc_repository/Process/Reference/Common/common.php';
/**
 * List all the parameters required by the task
 */
function list_args()
{
  create_var_def('name', 'String');
}
check_mandatory_param('name');

/**
 * get the value of name from the context and create a variable out of it
 */
$name=$context['name'];
/**
 * print the value in the log file /opt/jboss/latest/log/process.log 
 */
logToFile($name);

/**
 * End of the task do not modify after this point
 */
task_exit(ENDED, "Hello " . $name);

?>
----

Execute this process and watch the result on the console. It should look similar to what's shown below (except with your name).
