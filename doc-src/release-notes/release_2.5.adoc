Various fixes have been made to the product to ensure its continued ability to empower users, ensure a smoother user experience and deliver the value that businesses need in today's environment while being ahead in terms of features, being evergreen and the agility of the {product_name} to grow.

== New manager features

The following feature improvements are included with this release:

=== Workflow Execution Management

==== Execution Logs

=== Workflow Execution Management

==== Workflow Console Log

We have added a new log tab to the process execution console.

As the workflow process is running, the user can click on that "Logs" tab to see the log entries for this execution live (with a delay of a few seconds).

== New Developer Features

The following feature improvements are included with this release:

=== Workflow

==== Whitespace Highlighting

The Workflow code editor now highlights whitespace, such as spaces, tabs, and line returns.  

This is particularly important for Python users, as that language is whitespace sensitive.

==== Code Panel Maximization

We have added this new button on the top right of the code editor to maximize the size of the code panel in the Workflow editor, to give developers more screen space to see their code.

==== Keyboard Shortcuts

There are a list of keyboard shortcuts that our Workflow code editor supports.  

We have now started to document these in a new panel, which is accessible via a new "i" icon in the editor itself.

==== Code Completion

A common feature in code editors is code completion, where the code editor is smart enough to guess what object or function you might want to access next, and automatically suggest those to you.

Our code editor is able to do this now as it is aware of our proprietary SDK classes and methods.

== CoreEngine

== New Libraries Available

=== Adapters

== Upgrading

Instructions to upgrade available in the quickstart guide.

=== Specific instructions for upgrading from {revnumber-prev} to {revnumber}

Starting from version 2.2.0, the quickstart provides an upgrade script `upgrade.sh` for taking care of possible actions such as recreating some volume, executing some database specific updates,...

Let's say that you are running {product_name} version {revnumber-prev}, to upgrade to the version {revnumber}, you need to follow these steps:

1. `cd quickstart`
2. `git checkout master`
3. `git fetch --unshallow`
4. `git pull`
5. `git checkout tags/{revnumber} -b {revnumber}`
6. `./scripts/install.sh`
